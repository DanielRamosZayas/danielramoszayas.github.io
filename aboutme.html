    <h1>Bio.</h1>
    <p> It's a long name so just call me Daniel.</p>
  </div>
    <p> Daniel Ramos Zayas was born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico in the mid 1990s. From a young age he was drawn to visual artforms. The anime cartoon genre was a starting influence that led him to refine his illustration skills. After graduating high school, Daniel jumped straight into the workforce taking up employment in office administration jobs. </br></br> The year 2020 flipped the world on it's head. Everybody was home doing their due diligence at the dawn of a pandemic. While home, Daniel rediscovered his love for visual arts. Shortly after, he would attend FIRST Institute in Orlando, FL where he would study graphic design. He would complete an internship at a large, modern church under a seasoned graphic designer. There he would further develop his minimalist, sleek visual vocabulary. <br><br>
    He now utilizes his experience to provide brand identities, editorial and graphics as a freelancer.</p>
