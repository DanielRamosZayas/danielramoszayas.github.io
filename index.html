      <h2 id="History"> History</h2>
        <h3>Early Years</h3>

          <p>In 1953, K. R. Perry opened a Ben Franklin variety store in Norfolk, Virginia, which later became known as K&K 5&10.<br><br>

          In 1970, K. R. Perry, Doug Perry, and Macon Brock started K&K Toys in Norfolk, Virginia. This mall concept grew to over 130 stores on the East Coast.<br><br>

          In 1986, Doug Perry, Macon Brock, and Ray Compton started another chain store called Only $1.00 with five stores, one in Georgia, one in Tennessee, and three in Virginia. The expansion of dollar stores was continued alongside K&K Toys stores, mostly in enclosed malls.

        <h3>1990s</h3>

          <p>In 1993, the name Only $1.00 was changed to Dollar Tree Stores to address what could be a multi-price-point strategy in the future, and part equity interest was sold to SKM partners, a private equity firm.<br><br>

          Brock and the co-founders of Dollar Tree got the idea for the company from another retailer known as Everything's A Dollar, which went bankrupt in the 1990s.<br><Br>

          On March 6, 1995, Dollar Tree, Inc. went public on the NASDAQ exchange at $15 a share, with a market cap then calculated at <b>$225 million</b>. <br><br>

          In 1996, Dollar Tree acquired Dollar Bill$, Inc., a Chicago-based chain of 136 stores.<br><br>

          In 1997, the company opened its first distribution center and its new store support center, both located in Chesapeake, Virginia.<br><br>

          In 1998, Dollar Tree acquired 98-Cent Clearance Centers in California.<br><br>

          In 1999, Dollar Tree acquired Only $One stores based in New York state. That same year, the company opened its second distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi.

      <h2 id="businessstrategy">Business Strategy</h2>

          <p>Dollar Tree is classified as an extreme discount store. It claims to be able to achieve this because their buyers "work extremely hard to find the best bargains out there", and it has "great control over the tremendous buying power at the dollar price-point". Its prices are primarily designed to attract those with financial difficulties, but it has also become popular with more affluent customers.</p>

      <h2 id="Canada">Canada</h2>

          <p>Dollar Tree stores in Canada sell items for C$1.25 or less. On October 11, 2010, Dollar Tree announced its acquisition of Dollar Giant, originally incorporated in 2001 in Vancouver, Canada, for $52 million. At the time of the acquisition, Dollar Giant had about 85 retail outlets in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. <br><br>Approximately 30 of its retail locations are in British Columbia, making it the second largest dollar store chain in that province. It was Canada's fourth largest operator of dollar stores. Dollar Tree has since rebranded all of its Dollar Giant stores to Dollar Tree; these were the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree. The company now operates 227 stores across Canada, concentrated in Western Canada and Ontario. Dollar Tree Canada's merchandising team is located in Mississauga, Ontario, while its corporate office remains in Burnaby in Greater Vancouver.</p>

      <h2 id="recalls">Recalls</h2>

          <p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission lists several recalls for products sold at Dollar Tree stores. The recalled products include salsa jars with broken glass inside them, hot-melt mini glue guns (recalled in January 2008) which could short circuit and cause burns, and candle sets (recalled in February 2004) which could produce excessive flame.</p>
